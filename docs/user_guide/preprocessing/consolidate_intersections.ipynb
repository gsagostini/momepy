    "Whereas routing and transportation analysis of street networks must take into account precise street segment directionality and multiple street lanes, morphological analysis in these graphs considers only a coarsened version of their geometry. Details such as four-way intersections, transit exchanges, and roundabouts are often considered geometric \"noise\" and must be cleaned prior to analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "A particular issue arises when considering the intersection of multi-lane streets. Two perpendicular two-lane streets will intersect in four points, often creating a dummy city block---a polygon enclosed by street segments---in the network. This artifact can influence metrics on urban form such as block area or block eccentricity. We would prefer that these intersections were consolidated in a single vertex.\n",
